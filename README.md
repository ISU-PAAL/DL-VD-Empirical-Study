## Model overview

The code, scripts, and logs for the following models are included.

Full experiment data:
- Devign
- ReVeal
- ReGVD
- CodeBERT
- VulBERTa-CNN
- VulBERTa-MLP
- PLBART
- LineVul
- Code2Vec

Model reproduction data:
- SySeVR
- VulDeeLocator

Each model directory includes `code`, `scripts`, and `logs`.
- `code` contains the code distributed by the implementers of the model, plus our
  improvements to work on the MSR dataset and select cross-sections of the data.
- `scripts` contains the scripts we used to train/evaluate the models.
- `logs` contains the logged output from our reproduction and experiments.

The following models share parts of their implementation, and so are grouped in the same folder.
`VulBERTa-CNN` and `VulBERTa-MLP` are included in the directory named `VulBERTa-CNN_VulBERTa-MLP`.
`Devign` and `ReVeal` are included in the directory named `Devign_ReVeal`.

We reproduced the `CodeBERT` and the `VulBERTa` models on two different platforms during our experiments,
so these include two versions of the scripts which are mostly similar, except for minor implementation details.

We could not reproduce `VulDeeLocator` and `SySeVR`. VulDeeLocator requires the code to be compiled. Devign/MSR datasets contain many different real-world open-source projects; compiling all projects will not be practical. SySeVR needs to compute and label program slices. Labeling program slices correctly for large datasets like MSR and Devign is a real challenge. Their paper ([link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9321538)) mentioned that the authors manually checked 2,605 examples and corrected 1,641 of the labels.

All models take as input the data in `datasets`; however, the file paths are different from the platforms we used,
so the training/evaluation will not be directly able to run.

Some models take as input a `jsonl` format, which can be generated with the script: `cross_sections/code/data_creator.ipynb`.

## Code overview

These programs take data as input, but the file paths and `PYTHONPATH` are different from our platform, so they may not be directly able to run.
We attempted to include basic data in the same location so that the input and outputs are observable.

## Dataset overview

Dataset sources:
- Devign: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x6hoF7G-tSYxg8AFybggypLZgMGDNHfF/view?usp=sharing
  - We used the canonical splits provided by the CodeXGLUE project (https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Code/Defect-detection).
- MSR: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0VhnHBp9IGh90s2wCNjeCMuy70HPl8X/view?usp=sharing
  - As Fan et al. does not provide canonical dataset splits, we used the same splits generated by the LineVul authors.
